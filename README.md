- 👋 Hi, I’m @Clementina0312, a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology, open to opportunities as a Software Development Engineer
- 👀 I’m interested in web programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring Boot, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, Maven, ReactJS and Kubernetes
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some full stack project ideas
- 📫 How to reach me: ytang42@stevens.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I recently realized that software engineers need to learn a lot on their own. If they rely solely on the knowledge from school and do nothing else, they will be at a disadvantage in interviews.
